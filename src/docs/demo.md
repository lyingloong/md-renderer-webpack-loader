+ ^Calculation of Binding Efficiency^

	+ ^Structure Prediction and Preprocessing ^

        1.AlphaFold2 Prediction

        Input:The amino acid sequences of the constructed full-length protein and four deletion mutants (in the 199-202 region).

        Output: Five 3D protein structures (assessing confident regions with pLDDT > 80).
        2.Structure Optimization

        Loop regions were optimized using Modeller.

        Energy minimization was performed using AmberTools.
    + ^Molecular Binding Efficiency Analysis^

        1.Inputs:

        Crystal structure of the BoNT/A light chain.

        Predicted structures of the SNAP-25 mutants.

        2.Tool:

        ClusPro 2.0, which performs rigid-body docking based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

        3.Docking Process:

        ClusPro 2.0 first generates 70,000 different rotations of the ligand (e.g., SNAP-25 mutant). For each rotation, it performs translations along the x, y, and z axes relative to the receptor (e.g., BoNT/A light chain crystal structure), selecting the best-scoring translational combination for that rotation. From the 70,000 initial combinations, the 1,000 with the lowest scores are selected. These 1,000 conformations are then subjected to a greedy clustering analysis with a 9 Å C-alpha RMSD radius to identify the most likely binding poses.
        4.Docking Result:
        The output from ClusPro 2.0 typically consists of 1,000 low-energy results, which are clustered to find the native binding site with the widest free energy funnels. Results are presented in various formats, including the docked complex structures and scores for each model.

        Figure 2: Docking results of BoNT/A with SNAP-25 variants. 1: Wild-type protein. 2: Deletion of residue 202. 3: Deletion of 201-202. 4: Deletion of 200-202. 5: Deletion of 199-202. A lower score indicates higher potential cleavage efficiency.

        Figure 3: Labels correspond to the variants in Figure 2. These are the docking results of the different cleavage products with the Ste2 receptor protein. A lower score indicates stronger binding affinity. 6 is the control group, measuring the binding affinity between alpha-factor and the Ste2 receptor.

    + ^Results and Validation (Revised Method)^

        To obtain a more robust and physically meaningful metric for binding affinity, the initial approach of using a simple weighted average has been replaced with a method based on statistical mechanics. This approach correctly accounts for the contributions of all significant binding modes (clusters) based on their energy and population size.

        ^ Boltzmann-Weighted Score (BWS)^

        Instead of a simple composite score, a Boltzmann-Weighted Score (BWS) is calculated for each construct. This score aggregates the contributions of all docked clusters, giving more weight to lower-energy and more populated clusters, which is physically more representative of the overall binding propensity.  

        The formula is:

        \[text{BWS} = \sum_{i} \left( N_i \times e^{-E_i / kT} \right)\] 

        Parameter Definitions:

        *i*: An index for each cluster generated by ClusPro for a given construct.

        *N_i*: The number of members (population) in cluster i. This reflects the size of the conformational basin for that binding mode.

        *E_i*: The representative energy score of cluster i. It is recommended to use the cluster's Center score, as it is a better representation of the cluster's average energy and is less sensitive to single outliers than the Lowest_Energy score.


        *kT*: The thermal energy term. For ranking purposes with docking scores, kT can be effectively set to 1. This simplifies the calculation while preserving the crucial exponential relationship between energy and probability, ensuring that lower-energy states are weighted more heavily.

        ^ Relative Binding Efficiency (RBE)^

        Using the BWS, a direct and meaningful Relative Binding Efficiency (RBE) can be calculated. This ratio reflects how the overall binding propensity of a construct compares to a reference.   

        The formula is:   

        \[text{RBE}_{\text{construct}} = \left( \frac{\text{BWS}_{\text{construct}}}{\text{BWS}_{\text{reference}}} \right) \times 100\%\]

        Parameter Definitions:

        *BWS_construct*: The Boltzmann-Weighted Score calculated for the construct of interest.

        *BWS_reference*: The BWS of the baseline construct (e.g., the Control α-factor or the wild-type SNAP25 partial). This sets the 100% reference point for comparison.

        This revised methodology provides a more accurate and scientifically defensible ranking of the constructs' binding affinities.
